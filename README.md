# 💼 Personality Traits & Asset Value Analysis (GBP-Focused)

This project analyzes how individual personality traits relate to asset holdings (in GBP only). Data was sourced from a Supabase API and explored using Python with pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The goal was to uncover behavioral patterns among asset holders and document insightful visualizations and metrics.

I am deeply interested in this role as it aligns perfectly with my background in financial economics and hands-on experience in behavioural data analysis. I’ve worked on projects involving personality traits, digital finance, and interactive dashboards, which makes this opportunity an ideal fit. The chance to apply behavioural science to real-world financial decisions excites me. I’m eager to contribute meaningfully while gaining deeper insights into behavioural engagement tools.
